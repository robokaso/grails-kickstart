<h2>About</h2>

Aims to provide a template that helps to kick-start a best-practice grails projects. 

While the choices made are inevitably opinionated the project should still be generally useful:
* for beginners as a rich set of sensible defaults
* for advanced users as a concrete basis for discussing/reevaluating the choices made and pointing out
	additional plugins with orthogonal functionalities that improve the overall works-out-of-box experience.
* as an integration test proving that a rich set of generally useful plugins can live together nicely or point
	out the problems in case they don't
