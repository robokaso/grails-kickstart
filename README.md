About
-----

Aims to provide a template that helps to kickstart a best-practice grails projects. 

While the choices made are inevitably opinionated the project should still be generally useful:

* for beginners as a rich set of sensible defaults
* for advanced users as a concrete basis for discussing/reevaluating the choices made and pointing out
	additional plugins that improve the overall experience.
* as an integration test proving that the chosen set of plugins works together nicely or 
	showcase the necessary workarounds in case it doesn't
